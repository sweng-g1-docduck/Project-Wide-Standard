# Project Wide Standard

This repository contains the project wide standard for the software engineering project. It provides guidelines and rules to describe the expected elements in the XML documents to be interpreted by the software. It will be used to verify each piece of item content in a document, to assure it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in. The project wide standard ensures consistency, maintainability, and collaboration across the project.
